# Peter Ottsen - May 2021
# LidarViewer

Repository for my master's thesis project. The goal is to develop an all in one software tool for editing, aligning, then calculating the snowdepth based on two lidar scans of the same mountianous area.

The algorithms folder contains the work done for algorithms development, while the viewer folder has the most up to date working version. Run 'python master_main.py' from the command line.

The project will be updated as things are completed. More detailed description and user guide to come.
